<div id="quiz">How Well Do You Know Fallout?</div>
<main> 
    Fallout has captured the imagination of so many people since its first release. It's perhaps one of the deepest RPGs ever made, and it seems like every aspect of its world has been thought out completely.
    The franchise started out as a turn-based RPG, much like other games of that era, but has since evolved into a first-person-shooter with RPG elements. But the more primitive games from the 90's are still
    being downloaded and played to this day, because of their rich story and engrossing gameplay. Today, many people are simply obsessed with this series, and whenever a new game is announced, it's a major event
    in the video game community.
    It's actually pretty hard to keep track of all the lore in this video game. In order to learn everything there is to know about the Fallout universe, you would have to explore every area in every game, talk
    to every single person, and find all of the information written down or stored on an in-game computer. That's no easy feat, but people have in fact done it. So, are you up to the test? Think you're a true Fallout fan?
    There's only one way to find out... Take the test and see how closely you were paying attention to post-nuclear America...
